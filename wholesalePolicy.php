						<h3>Wholesale Policy</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<h4>Ordering:</h4>
								<p>The minimum wholesale purchase amount is $250.00. All products & pricing are subject to change & seasonal availability.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Payment:</h4>
								<p>We accept all major credit cards (AMEX, M/C, Visa, Discover), cash or check. All payments will be collected at the time of purchase.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Selling our Items:</h4>
                <p>Choicepark products may not be sold or advertised on any website for less than the prices listed on our website. Products sold in stores must be sold at MSRP</p>
								<p>Discounts for sale under retail are only allowed if the stock remains post-season. Choicepark products cannot be re-sold to other wholesalers for retail purposes & cannot be sold online or in-store to wholesale or discount outlets.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Private Label:</h4>
								<p>All Items purchased from Fashion & Compassion are under trademark protection & must display the Fashion & Compassion name. Under no circumstances may you sell Fashion & Compassion products under any other name, or reproduce products under this trademark.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Cancellations:</h4>
								<p>We do our best to ship items within 3 business days & because of this quick turnaround time, the window for cancelling orders is very short. If your cancellation request is seen prior to us processing your order, we are happy to cancel your order for a full refund, but once the order is in process, we can no longer cancel it.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Order Changes:</h4>
								<p>Due to processing time & inventory availability, we cannot honor change requests to orders after purchase. Please make sure to carefully review your order before submitting it.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Multiple Shipping Addresses:</h4>
								<p>We only ship to the shipping address provided & cannot ship to multiple addresses. If you would like your order shipped to various addresses, please place one order for each shipping address.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Returns/Exchanges:</h4>
								<p>ALL WHOLESALE ORDERS ARE FINAL AND CANNOT BE RETURNED OR EXCHANGED.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Returned Mail:</h4>
								<p>If a package is returned because the address provided to us was not correct, we are not responsible for re-shipping. We will contact the buyer for the correct address; shipping & handling charges will need to be re-paid before we can send the package again.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Lost/Damaged by Post Office:</h4>
								<p>We are not responsible for any errors made by the Post Office. However, if your package has not been received within 3 weeks of receiving your shipping notification email (6 weeks for international orders), please contact us & we will provide directions on how to file a claim with the USPS.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Damaged Items/Order Errors:</h4>
                <p>Though each product is inspected for quality assurance before shipping, it is possible to receive a damaged item. In addition, due to human error, order mistakes are possible. For these reasons, it is important to open & inspect your items as soon as you receive them.</p>
								<p>Please notify us within 5 business days of receiving your package if there is anything wrong with your order. We cannot honor changes outside of the time frames, as stated within our policies.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Damaged Replacements:</h4>
								<p>Once we have been notified of any damaged items you have received, we will work with you to get them corrected. Please note: we cannot extend any discounts to you should you decide to sell damaged items at a discount.</p>
		            <br>
                <h4>Discounts:</h4>
								<p>At times, we will promote items for a percentage off or a reduced shipping rate to our retail customers. These offers do NOT apply to wholesale orders. Coupon Codes for these offers cannot be used by a wholesale customer.</p>
                <p>Violation of any Choicepark wholesale policy will result in account termination.</p>
